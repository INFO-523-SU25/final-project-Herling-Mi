The system will first classify the genre of each audio track, then recommend songs with similar or complementary characteristics.\n\nThe motivation for this project is that detecting languages spoken in audio files and making requests based on user factors are well-suited for a small student project. The project provides valuable learning outcomes by involving real audio data, helping us understand the basics of signal processing, training classification models, and applying recommendation logic.\n\n## Dataset\n\n\nA brief description of your dataset including its provenance, dimensions, etc. as well as the reason why you chose this dataset.\n\nMake sure to load the data and use inline code for some of this information.\n\n## Questions\n\n1.  Try to classify the genre of an unseen audio file using extracted audio features.\n\n```         \nDevelop a system that can accurately classify the genre of music in audio files using established audio feature extraction and machine learning methods. This system should provide hands-on learning opportunities in signal processing and machine learning by working with real music data and training classification models.\n```\n\n2.  Based on genre classification and feature similarity, try to recommend songs that match a user’s listening history.\n\n    Create an extensible recommendation system that could incorporate additional genres, evolving user profiles, and more advanced recommendation strategies, ultimately delivering a personalized and engaging user experience.\n\n## Analysis plan\n\n-   A plan for answering each of the questions including the variables involved, variables to be created (if any), external data to be merged in (if any).\n\n",
