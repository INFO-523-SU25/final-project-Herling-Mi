This project applies signal processing, vocal separation (DEMUCS library), and machine learning techniques to classify song languages and integrate them with genre metadata for improved personalization. By combining automated data collection with advanced audio analysis, the system provides a foundation for smarter, more inclusive recommendation platforms that enhance user experience across diverse musical contexts. The project first applied Random Forests and Gaussian Mixture Models with 5-fold cross-validation for audio genre identification, then advanced to CNNs on spectrogram heat maps validated via a train/validation/test split with early stopping, evaluated through accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrices, and ROC curves.\n\n::: {style=\"background-color: #4CBB17; color: black; margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;\"}\n<b>Nathan #\\_to_Do</b>\n:::\n\n(Nathan) - sentence about results.\n\n::: {style=\"background-color: orange; color: black; margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;\"}\n<b>By applying statistical and time-frequency features to separated vocal and instrumental tracks, we evaluated the feasibility of machine learning models in song language recognition. Classical approaches such as Logistic Regression, Random Forests, and SVMs were trained with 5-fold cross-validation.

Accurate genre identification not only enhances music recommendation systems and streaming platforms but also deepens our understanding of audio structure and human perception of sound. Traditional approaches have relied on handcrafted audio features analyzed with machine learning techniques such as Random Forests and Gaussian Mixture Models, offering interpretable yet limited performance\\[1\\]. Recent advances, however, leverage deep learning methods—particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs)—to extract high-level representations directly from spectrograms, achieving state-of-the-art results\\[2\\]. This project explores both paradigms: first applying classical machine learning with 5-fold cross-validation, and then advancing to CNN-based classification on spectrogram heat maps, with results evaluated using standard metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrices, and ROC curves.\n\n## A note on spectographic features of <code>.mp3</code> vs. <code>.wav</code>\n\n::: {style=\"background-color: #4CBB17; color: black; margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;\"}\n<b>Nathan #\\_to_Do</b>\n:::\n\nHere i'll add a graph, and discuss who despite the large disparity in file size the two file types are nearly similar in audio data.

Recommendation Systems Using Audio Features & User Data\n\n#### <b>initial formulation</b>\n\nHow can **user interaction data**, combined with basic track metadata and simple audio features, be used to build an effective recommendation system using **collaborative filtering** and traditional machine learning methods?\n\n-   Furthermore, how can **advanced audio features**, **dimensionality reduction**, and **clustering techniques** improve personalized recommendations by better capturing user preferences and track characteristics from both vocal and non-vocal components?\\\n-   How do recommendation model results compare and contrast when using **.wav** files versus **.mp3** files, considering the potential impact of audio quality and compression artifacts on feature extraction and recommendation performance?\n\n#### <b>secondary formulation</b>\n\n::: {style=\"background-color: #4CBB17; color: black; margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;\"}\n<b>Nathan #\\_to_Do</b>\n:::\n\nFrom the initial problems statement - what did you change?\n\n## Dataset\n\n### data provenance\n\n::: {style=\"background-color: #4CBB17; color: black; margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;\"}\n<b>Nathan #\\_to_Do</b>\n:::\n\n### software distriubtion\n\n::: {style=\"background-color: #4CBB17; color: black; margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;\"}\n<b>Nathan #\\_to_Do</b>\n:::\n\n### data collection\n\n::: {style=\"background-color: #4CBB17; color: black; margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;\"}\n<b>Nathan #\\_to_Do</b>\n:::\n\n### data storage\n\n::: {style=\"background-color: #4CBB17; color: black; margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;\"}\n<b>Nathan #\\_to_Do</b>\n:::\n\n### graphs?\n\n::: {style=\"background-color: #4CBB17; color: black; margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;\"}\n<b>Nathan #\\_to_Do</b>\n:::\n\n<br><b>.. any feature graphs I can think of...</b>\n\n## Team member workload\n\n::: {style=\"background-color: orange; color: black; margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;\"}\n<b>Our project workload followed a structured week-by-week workflow, with responsibilities distributed among team members. We began by finalizing and sharing the proposal, followed by the individual collection and organization of \\~200 audio files per person.

Features included time-domain statistics (mean, variance, skewness, kurtosis).\n\n**Data Processing:** All features were standardized using global scaling. Encoded target variable (language) with LabelEncoder.No major imputation was required as missingness was minimal.\n\n**Model Selection:** I evaluated three models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines with linear kernels. These models were chosen for their balance of interpretability, robustness, and suitability for structured feature data. Training and evaluation were conducted using 5-fold stratified cross-validation to ensure reliable performance comparisons across models.\n\n**Validation & Metrics:** Evaluation focused on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Confusion matrices were used to analyze per-class misclassification patterns.\n\n**Model Evaluation:**</b>\n\n| Ablation       | Model        | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1    |\n|----------------|--------------|----------|-----------|--------|-------|\n| complete_song  | LogReg       | 0.399    | 0.398     | 0.447  | 0.387 |\n| complete_song  | RandomForest | 0.626    | 0.469     | 0.410  | 0.401 |\n| complete_song  | SVM_linear   | 0.432    | 0.443     | 0.504  | 0.427 |\n| vocal_only     | LogReg       | 0.560    | 0.531     | 0.567  | 0.509 |\n| vocal_only     | RandomForest | 0.552    | 0.426     | 0.404  | 0.385 |\n| vocal_only     | SVM_linear   | 0.544    | 0.542     | 0.583  | 0.514 |\n| no_vocal       | LogReg       | 0.333    | 0.371     | 0.364  | 0.316 |\n| no_vocal       | RandomForest | 0.577    | 0.436     | 0.349  | 0.328 |\n| no_vocal       | SVM_linear   | 0.366    | 0.418     | 0.411  | 0.347 |\n| **Column Min** | \\-           | 0.333    | 0.371     | 0.349  | 0.316 |\n| **Column Max** | \\-           | 0.626    | 0.542     | 0.583  | 0.514 |\n\n-   \n\n\n    ::: {#f97a3605 .cell fig-format='svg' fig-height='4' fig-width='7' execution_count=1}\n    \n    ::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n    ![](index_files/figure-html/cell-2-output-1.png){fig-align='center'}\n    :::\n    :::\n    \n    \n::: {style=\"background-color: orange; color: black; margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;\"}\n<b>**Results:**\n\n-   Vocal-only tracks: Provided the best classification signal, with SVM achieving \\~0.51 macro F1, outperforming Random Forest and Logistic Regression.\n\n-   Complete songs: Models achieved moderate performance (\\~0.40 F1), reflecting a mixture of useful vocal cues diluted by instrumental content.\n\n-   Non_vocal tracks: Accuracy dropped to \\~0.50 (random baseline), validating the expectation that language recognition requires vocal content.\n:::\n::::\n\n(1) restate question\n(2) data collection - data set size/composition (var types) Data was collected through a series of Python scripts. \\[see slide 3\\] You had an extra layer of feature extraction - removing vocal/instrumental tracts.\n(3) data processing - any PCA, correlation, imputation, outlier removal?\n(4) model selection - what models, why?

Our analysis demonstrated that vocal-only features drive most of the predictive signal, confirming that separated vocals provide the strongest basis for language recognition. These results demonstrate the potential of classical machine learning for this task, but also highlight its limits，larger datasets and deep learning methods will be needed for stronger multilingual classification in the future.</b>\n:::\n\nRestate the project goal, and the goal of your question.
