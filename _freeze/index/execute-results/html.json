This project applies signal processing, vocal separation (DEMUCS library), and machine learning techniques to develop a framework for classifying both music genres and song languages, integrating these predictions with genre metadata for improved personalization. By combining automated data collection with advanced audio analysis, the system provides a foundation for smarter, more inclusive recommendation platforms that enhance user experience across diverse musical contexts. The focus of the project was: langauge and genre recognition. For language recognition, classical models—including Logistic Regression, Random Forests, and SVMs—were trained on extracted statistical and time-frequency features using 5-fold cross-validation. These models showed modest predictive performance, with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-scores generally ranging from 10–60%, while vocal features provided stronger signals than instrumental components. Next, KNNs and Random Forests were applied with 'genre' as the target variable. Finally, CNNs were applied to Mel spectrogram images—both grayscale and color scale—with train/validation/test splits, early stopping, and hyperparameter sweeps to capture complex audio patterns. While all models had limited performance, CNNs have strong theoretical potential, as reported in the literature, and improved recognition compared to classical models, highlighting the promise of deep learning and feature engineering for future music recommendation and language identification systems.\n\n## Introduction\n\nMusic genre classification is a central task in the field of music information retrieval, combining elements of signal processing, machine learning, and deep learning. Accurate genre identification not only enhances music recommendation systems and streaming platforms but also deepens our understanding of audio structure and human perception of sound. Traditional approaches have relied on handcrafted audio features analyzed with machine learning techniques such as Random Forests and Gaussian Mixture Models, offering interpretable yet limited performance \\[1\\]. Recent advances, however, leverage deep learning methods—particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs)—to extract high-level representations directly from spectrograms, achieving state-of-the-art results \\[2\\]. This project explores both paradigms: first applying classical machine learning with 5-fold cross-validation, and then advancing to CNN-based classification on spectrogram heat maps, with results evaluated using standard metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrices, and ROC curves.\n\n## A note on spectographic features of <code>.mp3</code> vs. <code>.wav</code>\n\nInitially, it was assumed that the typical size difference between .mp3 and .wav files would reflect meaningful differences in their spectral properties. However, analysis revealed that the differences were minimal, leading us to abandon the idea of using the two file types as comparative baselines for our models. As shown in Figure 1, the typical similarity between <code>.wav</code> and <code>.mp3</code> files exceeds 98%, rendering the expectation of differing training results between the two data types a moot point.\n\n<div style=\"margin: 20px 40px; text-align: center;\">\n\n<img src=\"images/mp3_v_wav.png\" \n     alt=\"MP3 vs WAV\" \n     style=\"max-width: 80%; border-radius: 8px;\">\n\n<p style=\"margin-top: 10px; font-size: 14px; color: #444;\">\nFigure 1: Frequency histogram comparison between MP3 and WAV audio files.\n</p>\n\n</div>\n\n## A note on project software\nIt's generally easier and faster to run Python scrips separately and use the results in the discussion of the results.

Language Recognition with Separated Vocal & Audio Tracks\n\n#### <b>Initial Problem Formulation</b>\n\nHow can we leverage **statistical** and **time-frequency features** extracted from separated vocal and audio tracks to build effective language recognition models? Specifically, how can traditional machine learning methods — ranging from **classical classifiers** on simple statistical summaries to **Gaussian Mixture Models** on richer time-frequency features — be applied in this context?\n\n-   What are the key **benefits** and **limitations** of these approaches?\\\n-   How can **careful feature engineering**, **feature integration**, and **thorough model evaluation** improve the accuracy and robustness of language recognition systems?\\\n-   How do model results compare and contrast when using <code>**.wav**</code> files versus <code>**.mp3**</code> files?\n\n#### <b>Secondary Problem formulation</b>\n\n\nFrom the initial formulation, we refined the question to specifically compare how different ablations of the audio track (complete song, vocal-only, and non-vocal) affect model performance.\n\n-   How does model performance differ when predicting song language using features from complete songs, vocal-only tracks, and instrumental-only tracks?\n\n-   What are the relative strengths and limitations of classical machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM) when applied to language recognition?\n\n\n### 2. Recommendation Systems Using Audio Features & User Data\n\n#### <b>Initial Problem Formulation</b>\n\nHow can **user interaction data**, combined with basic track metadata and simple audio features, be used to build an effective recommendation system using **collaborative filtering** and traditional machine learning methods?\n\n-   Furthermore, how can **advanced audio features**, **dimensionality reduction**, and **clustering techniques** improve personalized recommendations by better capturing user preferences and track characteristics from both vocal and non-vocal components?\\\n-   How do recommendation model results compare and contrast when using <code>**.wav**</code> files versus <code>**.mp3**</code> files, considering the potential impact of audio quality and compression artifacts on feature extraction and recommendation performance?\n\n#### <b>Secondary Problem Formulation</b>\nWe abandoned the use of <code>.wav</code> versus <code>.mp3</code> formats for the reasons previously mentioned. Instead, the idea of using heat maps/spectrograms was discovered and pursued. A CNN was built for both grayscale and viridis-scale inputs. As will be discussed in the <b>Problem Analysis and Results</b> section, training outcomes were poor despite what initially seemed to be a solid approach. The current hypothesis is that the dataset is too small to produce a robust model, that the extracted song metrics are insufficient to support effective training, or a combination of both. The Likert scale—with options of 'Likert 2,' 'Likert 3,' and 'Likert 5'—was not employed, as it represents a second phase of recommendation by genre, contingent on reliable genre recognition. \n\n## Dataset\n\n### data provenance\n\nThe data collection process involved several custom Python scripts designed to scrape and download the necessary information and audio files:\n\n<code>**artist_5_song_list_scrape.py**</code> — Retrieves the top five songs per artist from Google search results.\n\n<code>**artist_genre_scrape.py**</code> — Gathers genre metadata for each artist from public sources.\n\n<code>**artist_country_of_origin_scrape.py**</code> — Extracts the country of origin for each artist.\n\n<code>**audio_scrape_wav_mp3.py**</code> — Downloads audio files from YouTube links in WAV and MP3 formats.\n\nTogether, these scripts automate the extraction of both audio data and relevant metadata to support training and evaluation of the recommendation system.\n\n<b>For question 1</b><br> \nA total of 123 songs were scraped, each was turned into the triplicate of (1) complete song, (2) audio only (3) vocal only. Yielding 369 observations to work with. The complete extraction pipeline for question 1 was around 15 hours.\n\n<b>For question 2</b><br> \nA total of 20 genres were examined, each with 10 example songs from relevant artists - yielding a set of 200 observations to work with. The complete extraction pipeline for question 2 was around 5 hours - due to the use of parallel threads in a reconfigured software file.\n\n### software distriubtion\n\nInitially, the plan was to distribute a software package to both partners so they could each collect their song files and extract the data locally. However, due to the ambitious goals and the multifaceted software requirements needed to accomplish them, the team soon felt as if we were flying the plane while building it. Ultimately, one team member (Nathan) took responsibility for collecting the song file data and generating the features. These features were then distributed to other members, replacing the originally envisioned feature-extraction software suite.\n\n### data features\n\nIn addition to the artist and song name, the features listed in Table 1 were scraped for each track. The final selection of features was guided as much by curiosity—‘I wonder what this will do’—as by deliberate planning. Research was done - but, until you try to build the model yourself you're not aware of what works under what condtions.\n\n:::: cell\n::: {style=\"width: 110%; margin: 0px -20px 30px -50px; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.2; border: 5px solid midnightblue; border-radius: 8px; padding: 8px 12px; background-color: #fdfdfd; overflow-x: auto;\"}\n<h2 style=\"color: #007ACC; margin: -10px 0 0px -20px; text-align: center; font-size: 2.0em;\">\n🔍 Feature Scraping\n</h2>\n\n| Feature | Description |\n|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------|\n| fundamental_freq | Fundamental frequency (mean pitch via librosa.pyin) |\n| freq_e_1 | Dominant spectral energy #1 (highest energy frequency bin) |\n| freq_e_2 | Dominant spectral energy #2 (2nd highest energy frequency bin) |\n| freq_e_3 | Dominant spectral energy #3 (3rd highest energy frequency bin) |\n| key | Estimated musical key (C, C#, D, ..., B) via chroma features |\n| duration | Length of audio in seconds |\n| zero_crossing_rate | Average zero crossing rate (signal sign changes) |\n| mfcc_mean | Mean of 13 MFCC coefficients (timbre features) |\n| mfcc_std | Standard deviation of MFCC coefficients |\n| tempo | Estimated tempo in beats per minute (BPM) |\n| rms_energy | Root mean square energy (loudness measure) |\n| track_type | Audio track type (0=full mix, 1=vocal only, 2=no vocals) |\n| mel_spectrogram | Mel-scaled spectrogram representing frequency content over time (human hearing range) |\n:::\n::::\n<p style=\"text-align:center; font-style:italic; margin-top:-20px;\">\nTable 1: Extracted Audio Features\n</p>\n\n\n### data storge\n\nThis <code>JSON</code> schema, as proposed in the original plan, was refactored as needed.

We began by finalizing and sharing the proposal, followed by the individual collection and organization of \\~200 audio files per person. Nathan Herling led the processing and validation of metadata, while each member focused on building machine learning pipelines and conducting iterative testing. The project concluded with a collaborative effort on final model evaluation, report preparation, and presentation development.\n\n\n## Problem analysis and results\n\n### General\n\nEasy and medium paths, as proposed in the proposal morphed into multiple paths to tackle the problem, some bearing fruit, some not. In Q1, it could be argued that three easy paths were taken in an attempt to explore which may work better, and in Q2 two easy paths and a medium path were explored.\n\n### Q1\n\n\n<b>**How can we leverage audio features from separated vocal and instrumental tracks to improve language recognition in music?**\n\n**Data Collection:** The dataset consisted of \\~200 audio files, preprocessed into three ablations: complete songs, vocal-only tracks, and instrumental-only tracks. Features included time-domain statistics (mean, variance, skewness, kurtosis).\n\n**Data Processing:** All features were standardized using global scaling. Encoded target variable (language) with LabelEncoder.No major imputation was required as missingness was minimal.\n\n**Model Selection:** I evaluated three models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines with linear kernels. These models were chosen for their balance of interpretability, robustness, and suitability for structured feature data. Training and evaluation were conducted using 5-fold stratified cross-validation to ensure reliable performance comparisons across models.\n\n**Validation & Metrics:** Evaluation focused on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Confusion matrices were used to analyze per-class misclassification patterns.\n\n**Model Evaluation:**</b>\n\n| Ablation       | Model        | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1    |\n|----------------|--------------|----------|-----------|--------|-------|\n| complete_song  | LogReg       | 0.399    | 0.398     | 0.447  | 0.387 |\n| complete_song  | RandomForest | 0.626    | 0.469     | 0.410  | 0.401 |\n| complete_song  | SVM_linear   | 0.432    | 0.443     | 0.504  | 0.427 |\n| vocal_only     | LogReg       | 0.560    | 0.531     | 0.567  | 0.509 |\n| vocal_only     | RandomForest | 0.552    | 0.426     | 0.404  | 0.385 |\n| vocal_only     | SVM_linear   | 0.544    | 0.542     | 0.583  | 0.514 |\n| no_vocal       | LogReg       | 0.333    | 0.371     | 0.364  | 0.316 |\n| no_vocal       | RandomForest | 0.577    | 0.436     | 0.349  | 0.328 |\n| no_vocal       | SVM_linear   | 0.366    | 0.418     | 0.411  | 0.347 |\n| **Column Min** | \\-           | 0.333    | 0.371     | 0.349  | 0.316 |\n| **Column Max** | \\-           | 0.626    | 0.542     | 0.583  | 0.514 |\n\n-   \n\n\n    ::: {#daf5f651 .cell fig-format='svg' fig-height='4' fig-width='7' execution_count=4}\n    \n    ::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n    ![](index_files/figure-html/cell-5-output-1.png){fig-align='center'}\n    :::\n    :::\n    \n    \n<b>**Results:**\n\n-   Vocal-only tracks: Provided the best classification signal, with SVM achieving \\~0.51 macro F1, outperforming Random Forest and Logistic Regression.\n\n-   Complete songs: Models achieved moderate performance (\\~0.40 F1), reflecting a mixture of useful vocal cues diluted by instrumental content.\n\n-   Non_vocal tracks: Accuracy dropped to \\~0.50 (random baseline), validating the expectation that language recognition requires vocal content.\n\n- Future reommendations: larger data sets and more hyperparameter exploration\n\n\n### Q2\n\nHow can we leverage audio features to construct a machine learning model capable of genre recognition?\n\n- Data Collection:<br>\nData collection was performed with python scripts for each feature listed in Table 1.

By accurately identifying spoken language within songs and combining this information with genre metadata, the system aims to suggest tracks that more closely align with individual user preferences. The challenge involved processing raw audio data, separating vocal from instrumental components, extracting meaningful statistical and time-frequency features, and applying both classical machine learning models and deep learning architectures to capture the underlying patterns in music.\n\nTo address these goals, the team experimented with a variety of models. Classical approaches—including Logistic Regression, Random Forests, and Support Vector Machines—were trained on extracted audio features using cross-validation, yielding modest predictive performance with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-scores generally between 10–60%. K-Nearest Neighbors and Random Forests were applied for genre classification, while Convolutional Neural Networks were trained on Mel spectrogram images (grayscale and color), using early stopping and hyperparameter sweeps to optimize performance. Although the models demonstrated only limited overall accuracy, CNNs showed comparatively stronger results and align with literature on deep learning’s potential for audio analysis. Future improvements may include expanding the dataset size, refining spectrogram preprocessing, exploring deeper or more specialized architectures, and integrating more robust feature engineering to enhance both language and genre recognition for more effective recommendation systems.\n\n\n## Video links\n\n```{=html}\n<div class=\"video-container\" style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<video width=\"640\" height=\"360\" controls>\n  poster=\"_extra/_images/data_group.png\"\n  <source src=\"_extra/523_proj_video.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">\n  Your browser does not support the video tag.\n</video>\n</div>\n```\n\n\n## Audio Player Demo\n\nA demo of the Ui/Ux audio player written for this project.
