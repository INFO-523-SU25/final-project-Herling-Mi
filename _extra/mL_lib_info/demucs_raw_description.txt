Demucs (Deep Extractor for Music Sources) is an open-source tool developed by Meta AI, 
designed for high-quality music source separation. Originally introduced to outperform traditional 
spectral mask methods, it uses a deep learning architecture based on convolutional layers and 
bidirectional LSTM to separate audio into distinct stems like vocals, drums, bass, and others. 
Unlike classical techniques that rely on frequency-domain heuristics, Demucs operates directly in the time 
domain, enabling precise extraction of overlapping audio components. For multilingual analysis, 
Demucs is especially effective because it isolates vocals based purely on acoustic features — not 
linguistic content — making it an ideal front-end for tasks like spoken language identification or lyric 
classification in machine learning pipelines.
