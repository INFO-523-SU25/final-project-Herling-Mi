Originally introduced to outperform traditional spectral mask methods, it uses a deep learning architecture based on convolutional layers and bidirectional LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) to separate audio into distinct stems like vocals, drums, bass, and others. Unlike classical techniques that rely on frequency-domain heuristics, Demucs operates directly in the time domain, enabling precise extraction of overlapping audio components.

    "text": "Dataset\n\nData - Provenence\nAll audio data used in this project was sourced from YouTube, following an automated pipeline designed to gather relevant tracks for training and evaluation:\n\nA list of artist names was manually curated.\nFor each artist, their top five songs were identified by scraping Google search results.\nYouTube links corresponding to those songs were retrieved using a custom scraping script.\nAudio from each YouTube video was downloaded and stored for analysis.\n\nIn addition to audio collection, a secondary scraper was developed to gather metadata. This tool extracted the most commonly associated genres and countries of origin for each artist by querying publicly available sources.\n\n\nData - Collection\nThe data collection process involved several custom Python scripts designed to scrape and download the necessary information and audio files:\nartist_5_song_list_scrape.py — Retrieves the top five songs per artist from Google search results.\nartist_genre_scrape.py — Gathers genre metadata for each artist from public sources.\nartist_country_of_origin_scrape.py — Extracts the country of origin for each artist.\naudio_scrape_wav_mp3.py — Downloads audio files from YouTube links in WAV and MP3 formats.\nTogether, these scripts automate the extraction of both audio data and relevant metadata to support training and evaluation of the recommendation system.\n\n\nData - Description\nThis table provides a comprehensive overview of the audio and metadata features considered during project development. It details each feature’s definition, data type, output format, and extraction notes.

This format organizes information for easy ingestion by machine learning pipelines or user interfaces, capturing both objective metadata (artist, categories, audio features) and subjective user ratings using Likert scales of varying lengths.\nAudio files and any complex metadata such as multi-dimensional arrays (e.g., spectrograms) will be stored in separate folders, with their file paths referenced in the JSON under the AudioFile node.\nJSON Node Storage Categories\nIn hierarchical data structures like JSON, a node represents a single element in the tree. Nodes can be categorized by the type of data they store and their structural role. Here is a list of the strucured schemea in our JSON:\nAudioFile: Nested object containing lists of links to YouTube, WAV, and MP3 versions of the audio files.\nRegion, User: Lists to hold geographic metadata and user identifiers. The User field, along with the Likert rating arrays, are pre-built placeholders designed to support future features such as user accounts and the collection of personalized likeability or preference ratings.\nData: A comprehensive sub-node capturing detailed metadata about the audio, including:\n\nArtist and song title\nGenre(s)\nQuantitative audio features such as mean, variance, skewness, kurtosis, zero crossing rate, RMS energy, loudness, energy, tempo, danceability\nMusical attributes like key and mode\nComplex audio representations like FFT, STFT, mel-spectrogram, frequency vs dB spectrum\nDuration in milliseconds\n\nLikert_2, Likert_3, Likert_5: Arrays representing different Likert scales, each with entries for score, label, color, description, and selection status to capture nuanced user feedback.\ncategory: An array of genre tags associated with the song.\nThis JSON schema is designed to be flexible and extensible, accommodating rich metadata and user feedback for building and improving recommendation systems.

It was included in the initial design of the .JSON file with the idea that incorporating it early would enable potential use in the current phase and support software design aligned with future phases or iterations of the project. The intended use of the Likert score is as a UI/UX feature for users. The initial approach will involve encoding the Likert scores and using them as input features, rather than as target variables. The machine learning component will aim to provide a gradient of score values, allowing users to express preferences (likes/dislikes) with greater precision. The goal is to develop a model capable of handling varying Likert scale gradients and their corresponding precision for more accurate recommendations..\nIn our design, each user will have their own Likert score database (or user-specific rating entries) linked to their unique user ID. This ensures that preference modeling and recommendation outputs are truly personalized. The idea is to allow users to “score” their like or dislike of individual songs and then see how the recommendation model adapts to those inputs. To make the interaction more engaging, users can choose between a 2-, 3-, or 5-point Likert scale.\n\n\nData - Second Tier features\nThe second tier of data features will focus on vocal track extraction, utilizing the DEMUCS library. Currently, the plan is to develop a dedicated script that processes each song’s audio files—both .mp3 and .wav formats—and stores the resulting vocal isolation data in individual, well-organized folders. As additional processing requirements emerge, the structure of the master JSON file may need to be adapted or reorganized to accommodate these new data components seamlessly. This approach ensures flexibility and scalability in handling complex audio feature sets while maintaining clear data management practices.\n\n\nThe Audiophiles custom audiofile ui\nA custom audio player UI that supports .wav and .mp3 files and dynamically renders decibel versus frequency spectrograms for each song. The player features real-time analysis with frequency, time, and dB spectrogram visualizations synchronized to the playback - i.e., a scrolling frequency,time,dB heat map. Additionally, there may be a need to build a JSON reader to facilitate the processing and aggregation of Likert scale scores associated with the songs.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: ‘Mk_1’ - Custom audio player UI displaying real-time frequency, time, and dB spectrograms synchronized to playback.\n\n\nAdditional Script info, Data Storage, Data Extraction:\nAll additional processing tasks are handled via custom Python scripts. These scripts include tools for downloading .mp3 and .mp4 files, and will be maintained individually by each team member. Due to the volume of data involved—approximately 200 .wav files and 200 .mp3 files—these audio assets will be stored locally on each user’s machine and not uploaded to GitHub.\nOnce metadata has been successfully extracted and organized, it can be safely stored and versioned within the GitHub repository. Similarly, any machine learning models developed throughout the project will be saved in the GitHub repo for reproducibility and collaboration.\nScripts for metadata extraction will be developed by Nathan and distributed to the rest of the team. Additional scripts and processing pipelines required for addressing specific research tasks will be created by individual team members as needed."

    "text": "Analysis plan\n\nPreamble: Easy and Medium Paths\nThe Easy Path serves as a minimal, foundational implementation aimed at quickly establishing a baseline for language recognition using straightforward statistical features extracted from separated vocal and audio tracks. It relies on classical machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines, which are simple to train and interpret.\nThe Medium Path provides a more detailed approach that extends beyond simple statistics by incorporating time-frequency features such as Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs), spectral centroid, and bandwidth from both vocal and non-vocal tracks. Instead of deep learning, this path uses classical probabilistic models like Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs), Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), or advanced classical classifiers trained on aggregated time-frequency features. This allows capturing richer audio characteristics while maintaining interpretability and computational efficiency.\n\n\nAnalysis Plan for Problem 1: Language Recognition\n\n\n1.

Aggregate these features by computing summary statistics (mean, variance).\n\nNormalize numerical features (StandardScaler or Min-Max scaling).\n\nEncode categorical metadata if available (e.g., one-hot encoding for language labels or artist).\n\n\n\n2.
